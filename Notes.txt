Verbots basic knowledgebase files are pretty simple to understand but only if you have the source.

You must already know that it is built on C#. With that said, conditions structures are built like a equal scale.
If you save a variable: <?csharpvars["[something]"] = "[something]";?>
To retrieve it you do: (string)vars["[something"] == "[something]"

The retrieval process is the condition. It can do a lot of things with variables. Verbots has set variables with the SDK such as:

[_time]
[_time24]
[_date]
[_month]
[_dayofmonth]
[_year]
[_dayofweek]
[_input]
[_lastinput]
[_lastoutput]

All of which is automatically made when you start the knowledge base. So if you want your Verbot 
to greet differently at 2 o'clock in the morning in your _startup (you can make it automatically start 
this command) command you do something like this:

Inputs: _startup
Outputs
Output: "It's 2 o'clock, why are you awake?"
Condition: (string)vars["_time24"] == "2:00"

When it is 2 in the morning your verbot will greet with your output.
Alot of the advanced functioning is removed from the real version in the SDK. Being that all the information 
is gone and you don't have a working original copy let me give you the decompiled project files for the full version.

You can get it at Verbots Shutdown

Looking throughout the code you can get more information and implement it in your application.

Hopefully you can get it working. (please note I didn't link the references in the package, if you do so 
you might be able to start the applications)
